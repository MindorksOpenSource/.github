### Saying Good Bye!

Janishar Ali and Amit Shekhar started MindOrks in 2017 to share their love of coding with the community. It evolved from an Android development learning platform to a full-fledged company serving 3 million developers worldwide. Our learning resources helped students and developers get better at work.

The love we received as part of the journey is overwhelming. Life moves on and so do we. Today we announce the closing of the MindOrks and AfterAcademy.

We have tried to preserve the learning resources that benefitted the community. You can find the learning resources now at these places:
1. https://janisharali.com
2. https://amitshekhar.me
3. https://www.youtube.com/@janisharali
4. https://blog.mindorks.com
5. https://afteracademy.com

The paid services will be available for the time it is needed.
